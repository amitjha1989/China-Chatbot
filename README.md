Dialogflow Chatbot

Project: China-Chatbot
Install

This project requires node js. You need to install node js to run react JS script.

We recommend you to install Node Js and all dependency that contains all of the necessary libraries and software for this project.

Code

In code, we connect with dialogflow where we have all intents and response. Chatbot work based on keywords that define in intents, based on user response it will search the keywords in dialogflow intents and here we have response as well.
Currently in this project I use direct conversation like FAQ. You can design based on your requirement if you want to increase the response just need to create additioanl intents, if you want more dynamic data like getting data from database or some other server then you need to integrate those server and get the response.

Thanks!
